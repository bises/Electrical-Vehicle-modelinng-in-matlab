Electrical Vehicle Simulation in Matlab jjjjj
Using the static and dynamic equation for calculation of different parameters of the electric vehicle, a mathematical model was developed. The final output of this modeling was the voltage, current and rpm requirement at different gear ratios for different speed. In general different parameters for Tire, motor, battery pack and vehicle body was calculated.
